# 👋 Hey there! I'm Kusum Bhattarai Sharma :)

Welcome to my GitHub! 👩‍💻 I'm a **Computer Science student**, **tech enthusiast**, and a **learner** who loves coming up with creative solutions through code. Whether it’s a nifty AI model, a sleek web app, or a fun side project, I enjoy turning big ideas into reality.  


When I'm not coding, you’ll find me:  
- Watching **Formula 1** and rooting for my favorite drivers. 🏎️  
- Reading books and articles about **Philosophy, Astrophysics, and Computer Science.** 📚
- Always looking for the perfect balance between **creativity and logic**, hehe ;)
